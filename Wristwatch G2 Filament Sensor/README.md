# Filament Sensor version of WWG2

WristWatch G2 from https://github.com/tetsu97/WristWatch-G2-Extruder 

Added a spot under the extruder gears for an omron microswitch and 4mm ball bearing to act as a post-extruder filament sensor. 
Useful for MMU devices like an ERCF.
The only modified part is the Front_Body. The Rear_plate and Tension_Arm are the exact same as from Tetsu's github.
