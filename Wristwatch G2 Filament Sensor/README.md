# Probably don't use this mod!

Before coninuing, yes this mod does work fine, but ByThorsThunder made an altogether better version that uses 5.5mm balls (like what the ERCF team uses). You can find it at https://github.com/bythorsthunder/Voron_Mods/tree/main/Wristwatch_G2_Dual_Filament_Sensor

There is no reason to use my version over Thor's unless you are stuck with only having 4mm ball bearings.

# Filament Sensor version of WWG2

Original WristWatch G2 by Tetsu from https://github.com/tetsu97/WristWatch-G2-Extruder 

Added a spot under the extruder gears for an omron microswitch and 4mm ball bearing to act as a post-extruder filament sensor. 
Useful for MMU devices like an ERCF.
The only modified part is the Front_Body. The Rear_plate and Tension_Arm are the exact same as from Tetsu's github.

There is also a version that has an extra "apron" mounting point and fits on the Xol G2SA hotend mount (not the WWG2 mount). I only did this because I was changing from G2SA to WWG2 and didn't want to change any other parts of the Xol.
