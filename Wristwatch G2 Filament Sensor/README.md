# Filament Sensor version of WWG2

Original WristWatch G2 by Tetsu from https://github.com/tetsu97/WristWatch-G2-Extruder 

Added a spot under the extruder gears for an omron microswitch and 4mm ball bearing to act as a post-extruder filament sensor. 
Useful for MMU devices like an ERCF.
The only modified part is the Front_Body. The Rear_plate and Tension_Arm are the exact same as from Tetsu's github.

There is also a version that has an extra "apron" mounting point and fits on the Xol G2SA hotend mount (not the WWG2 mount). I only did this because I was changing from G2SA to WWG2 and didn't want to change any other parts of the Xol.
