# Minilith Panels for v0

Inspired by CloakedWayne's Monolith panels (and built up from some similar designs he shared with me), these are mostly printed panels for a v0
with the idea to help with insulation (compared to stock acrylic panels) and to be easily removable with just clips or magnets.

It uses the stock front door panel, and stock magnet door latch things, but everything else is printed.

The side and rear panels all clip on to the extrusions using 1515-sized clips. The front door hinges on a pair of m3 screws that are screwed in to
the hinge-side panel.

For the tophat, there are clip-based top and side panels if you use the v0.2 extrusion tophat (mileage may vary, I don't have one to test on).

There is also an entirely printed tophat frame that uses clip-on side and rear panels, but 6x3mm magnets to hold the front panel and lid on.
This allows for no "beam" across the top front, so with the door open and the magnet lid/front removed you have full uninterrupted access to the toolhead.

The widened skirts aren't necessary, the panels will still fit fine with the stock v0 skirts, but I liked the look of the "stanced-out" skirts and 
it also let me have more room underneath for a larger power supply.

The front and side skirts attach to the frame just like the stock ones do. The rear skirt attaches to the rear legs (one of which can be the BOWDEN version
which lets you run the bowden tube through it. Mirror the STL to change the side it is on).

There is a new bottom panel which simply screws into the skirts directly (no heatsets or anything)

Note, this isn't my best work, some of the faces on the bodies may be slightly wonky (thank's Fusion360). They all print fine, but if you are going to modify
them you may run into weird issues that require a heavier hand to fix.
