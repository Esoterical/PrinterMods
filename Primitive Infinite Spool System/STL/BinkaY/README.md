# BinkaY

The BinkaY is a combined Y-splitter *and* Binky encoder *and* Belay-style speed controller.

It uses a D2F-L switch for the speed control and simple collets (ID 4.2mm OD 6mm) to hold on to the bowden tubes.

It's not pretty, but it's functional. Feel free to modify as you see fit, the step file is in the CAD folder.
