# Dual Nightwatch

I had a version of the Dual Pocketwatch by @HartK that I modified for extra filament sensors. It worked, but was a typical Esoterical hack job. If you need it (or if you only have 4mm ball bearings for the filament sensor) I've moved it to the Archive folder.

The "New" Dual Nightwatch, designed by someone with skill (@HartK himself) has everything my old one did but better. It uses 5.5mm ball bearings for a smoother filament actuation path as well as other small design tweaks.

# Splitter

A 2-into-1 splitter (or combiner) designed by Christoph (@pixelpieper) which I modified to take PC4M6 fittings instead of the original M10 ones.
