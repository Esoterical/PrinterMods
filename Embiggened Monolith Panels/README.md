# Embiggened Monolith Panels

A simple mod of CloakedWayne's brilliant [Monolith Panels](https://github.com/CloakedWayne/Monolith_Panels)

Made each part "taller" in order to fit 10mm foam and 6mm edging foam onto the panels for insulation.

Also widened the "claw" part of the clips by 5 degrees on each arm to give a bit more grip. Both versions are still in the CAD.

Included a foam cutter jig that I used to cut the 18mm wide edging foam strips into 9mm wide strips. Simply insert the foam and use a *sharp* scalpel of something in the slot on the top then pull the foam through. It will cut the foam in half as you pull.

The main foam I used is 10mm thick self-adhesive Polyethelyne foam. Came on a 750mm wide by 1.8m long roll.

The edging foam was 6mm thick 18mm wide closed-cell foam (seems the same as the other stuff, but in strip form) which I cut down to 9mm wide using the jig.

I covered the entire PC/Acrylic panel edge-to-edge in the main 10mm foam, then stuck the 6mm foam edging to the 10mm foam so there was a total of 16mm of foam along the edges where the panel will be touching the aluminium extrusion.
