# Embiggened Monolith Panels

A simple mod of CloakedWayne's brilliant [Monolith Panels](https://github.com/CloakedWayne/Monolith_Panels)

Made each part "taller" in order to fit 10mm foam and 6mm edging foam onto the panels for insulation.

Also widened the "claw" part of the clips by 5 degrees on each arm to give a bit more grip. Both versions are still in the CAD.

Included a foam cutter jig that I used to cut the 18mm wide edging foam strips into 9mm wide strips. Simply insert the foam and use a *sharp* scalpel of something in the slot on the top then pull the foam through. It will cut the foam in half as you pull.

The main foam I used is 10mm thick self-adhesive Polyethelyne foam. Came on a 750mm wide by 1.8m long roll.

The edging foam was 6mm thick 18mm wide closed-cell foam (seems the same as the other stuff, but in strip form) which I cut down to 9mm wide using the jig.

I covered the entire PC/Acrylic panel edge-to-edge in the main 10mm foam, then stuck the 6mm foam edging to the 10mm foam so there was a total of 16mm of foam along the edges where the panel will be touching the aluminium extrusion.

During assembly I found that dipping the "back" face of the clips in acetone then installing the clip into the frame allowed it to acetone-weld to the frame making a crazy strong bond. Didn't need much, just to make that highlighted face wet with acetone, doesn't need to go up the sides or anything else. (Obviously, this is if using ABS for the parts)

# Parting the kimono

For anyone interested, here is the entire embiggening process.

1. Cut the body on the face that would be in contact with the "outer" side of the acrylic panel

2. Move the new "bottom" body down the desired distance. I've found 10mm works well for adding 10mm of insulation foam with 6mm of edging foam

3. Extrude the bottom face of the "top" body down the same distance so it meets with the other moved body and joins it all together again (you may have to do a seperate "join" step if this doesn't join automatically)

That's it. My secrets exposed.
