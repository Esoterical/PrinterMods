# Embiggened Monolith Panels

A simple mod of CloakedWayne's brilliant [Monolith Panels](https://github.com/CloakedWayne/Monolith_Panels)

Made each part "taller" in order to fit 10mm foam and 6mm edging foam onto the panels for insulation.

Also widened the "claw" part of the clips by 5 degrees on each arm to give a bit more grip. Both versions are still in the CAD.

Included a foam cutter jig that I used to cut the 18mm wide edging foam strips into 9mm wide strips. Simply insert the foam and use a *sharp* scalpel of something in the slot on the top then pull the foam through. It will cut the foam in half as you pull.
