# A simple 1 to 2 JST splitter for dual-part-fan toolheads

This splitter is designed to fit in the space on an EBB36 CAN board where the PT100/1000 DIP switches would be (for the boards that *don't* have the MAX31865 chip).

It uses the same main body and has 2 insert options either for JST-XH (2.54mm pitch) or JST-PH (2mm pitch)

Simply slide the two JST headers into the insert, then solder wires to the connectors and crimp a JST-XH onto the end of this wire to then connect to the EBB board header.

I then use a glob of hot glue to secure the JST "insert" into the main body.
