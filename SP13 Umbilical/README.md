# SP13 Umbilical Mounts

Just some work-in-progress mounts for an SP13 connector.
These are all designed around just sliding the SP13 in and then using the included nut to clamp it down (make sure to buy the versions with the "back nut")

There is an "SP13 Template" in the CAD which has red exclusion zones above and below. As long as your part doesn't have bits that enter these "zones" then the SP13 should fit fine.

I've included a 3-legged EBB36 mount that fits onto a customised Wristwatch G2 Extruder as I wanted the extra rigidity of the thrid mouting point but didn't want to use the same screws that mount the motor.

The most "finalised" model here is the mount for the Trident gantry, replacing the stock cable cover.
